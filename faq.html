        <li class="question">I have only taken intro to computer science/donâ€™t know much. Can I still participate?

                    Absolutely! Intro teaches you plenty of fundamentals to actually build something cool and useful. A
                    hackathon is also a great way to get introduced to a lot of aspects of software engineering that you
                    might not encounter otherwise.
